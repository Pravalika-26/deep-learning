# deep-learning
after the excution,There are few observations:
Hidden Layers: 3- Neurons per Layer: 128, Activation: ReLU, Optimizer: Adam, Regularization: 0.0005 → Best accuracy

Hidden Layers: 4-Neurons per Layer: 64, Activation: ReLU, Optimizer: RMSprop, Regularization: 0.0005 → Good balance between speed and accuracy

Hidden Layers: 5-Neurons per Layer: 32, Activation: Sigmoid, Optimizer: SGD, Regularization: 0.0 → Lower accuracy but good for comparison
